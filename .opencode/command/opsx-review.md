Review OpenSpec artifacts (proposal, design, tasks, specs) for quality and completeness.

---

## Input

Optionally specify `[change-name] [artifact-id]` after `/opsx-review`. If omitted, the AI will infer from context or prompt for selection.

**Patterns**:
| Input | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `/opsx-review add-auth proposal` | Review specific artifact in specific change |
| `/opsx-review add-auth` | Review entire change (all artifacts) |
| `/opsx-review` | Infer from context or prompt |

---

## Steps

1. **Select the change**

   If name provided: use it. Otherwise:
   - Infer from conversation context
   - Auto-select if only one active change
   - If ambiguous: run `openspec list --json` and use **AskUserQuestion** to prompt

   Announce: "Reviewing change: <name>" and how to override.

2. **Check status to understand schema**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse JSON for: schemaName, artifact list with statuses.

3. **Select artifact to review**

   If artifact ID specified: review that one. Otherwise:
   - Review all artifacts in schema order
   - For each artifact, read and validate

4. **Single artifact review**

   For each artifact:
   - Identify type (proposal/spec/design/tasks)
   - Read artifact file
   - Check required sections exist
   - Validate format (headers, scenario levels, checkbox format)
   - Review content quality (specificity, clarity)
   - Report issues with line numbers

5. **Cross-artifact consistency checks**

   When reviewing entire change:
   - proposal Capabilities match specs/ folder structure
   - proposal What Changes covered by tasks.md
   - design.md decisions referenced in tasks
   - All proposal Capabilities have corresponding specs

6. **Prioritize and report**

   Categories:
   - **Critical**: Must fix before archive
   - **Warning**: Should fix
   - **Suggestion**: Nice to have
