Modify an existing artifact in an OpenSpec change.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, the skill will try to infer from conversation context or auto-select if only one active change exists.

**Steps**

1. **Select the change**

   If a name is provided, use it. Otherwise:
   - Try to infer from conversation context if the user mentioned a change
   - If only one active change exists: auto-select it
   - If multiple active changes and no inference: run `openspec list --json` and use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select

   When showing changes, include: name, schema, status, last modified. Mark the most recently modified as "(Recommended)".

   Always announce: "Using change: <name>" and how to override (e.g., "/opsx:modify-artifact <change> <artifact>")

2. **Check change status**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow being used (e.g., "spec-driven")
   - `artifacts`: Array of artifacts with status (done/ready/blocked)
   - `isComplete`: Whether all artifacts are done
   - `applyRequires`: Artifacts needed before implementation

3. **Select artifact to modify**

   If an artifact ID is specified, use it. Otherwise:
   - If only one artifact has status "ready": auto-select it
   - If user described content (e.g., "the requirements", "the design"): match by name
   - If multiple artifacts ready and no direction: use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to prompt

   When prompting, present artifacts in schema order, showing:
   - Artifact ID
   - Status (done/ready/blocked)
   - Dependencies count
   - Unlocks count

4. **Get modification context**
   ```bash
   openspec instructions <artifact-id> --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON to extract:
   - `rules`: Validation rules for this artifact
   - `context`: Project background (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
   - `template`: Expected structure
   - `dependencies`: Artifacts this artifact depends on
   - `unlocks`: Artifacts that depend on this one
   - `outputPath`: Where the artifact file is located
   - `instruction`: Schema-specific guidance

   **Read the current artifact file** from `outputPath`.

5. **Display validation constraints**

   Show the user:
   - `rules` array (as constraints, not content)
   - `dependencies` list (what this artifact relies on)
   - `unlocks` list (what artifacts depend on this)

6. **Determine modification mode**

   **Mode A: Describe Changes** - Use when user provides natural language:
   - "Add a requirement for..."
   - "Update the design to..."
   - "Remove this section..."

   **Mode B: Interactive Edit** - Use when user references specific content:
   - "Change line 42 to..."
   - "Replace the second paragraph..."
   - "Update the authentication section..."

   Decision: Auto-select based on input type. No explicit prompt needed.

7. **Apply modifications based on mode**

   **Mode A (Describe Changes)**:
   - Parse user's description
   - Analyze current artifact content
   - Identify which sections need changes
   - Apply changes autonomously if clear
   - If ambiguous or uncertain: pause and ask for clarification using AskUserQuestion

   **Mode B (Interactive Edit)**:
   - Parse entire artifact file
   - Identify relevant sections based on user's edit intent
   - Show only those sections (not the entire file)
   - User provides specific edit instructions
   - Apply targeted changes using Edit tool
   - If more sections need changes, repeat

8. **Validate modifications**

   Check the proposed changes against the `rules` array from step 4 (`openspec instructions` output):

   1. Identify any rule violations
   2. Clear/fixable violations → Fix automatically and continue
   3. Ambiguous violations → Explain issue and ask user
   4. If user's intent is clear despite violation → Proceed with warning

   Note: Use the `rules` from instructions, do NOT run `openspec validate`.

9. **Write the updated artifact file**

   Use Edit tool for targeted changes, Write tool for complete rewrites.

   Verify the file was written successfully.

10. **Handle dependent artifacts**

     From the instructions output, check the `unlocks` array (reverse dependencies).

     **For each artifact in `unlocks`**:
     - Run `openspec instructions <dependent-id> --change "<name>" --json`
     - Read the dependent artifact file
     - Analyze if the modification affects this dependent artifact
     - Track affected artifacts

     **Decision logic** (prefer reasonable decisions):
     - **0-1 affected**: Auto-update and explain (no prompt)
     - **2+ affected**: Show the list and prompt for confirmation
     - **User mentioned "cascade"**: Auto-update regardless of count

     **When auto-updating**:
     - Apply the same modification principles
     - Summarize changes after all updates complete
     - Mark dependent artifacts as modified

11. **Show success summary**

     Display:
     - Which artifact was modified
     - Changes applied (summary)
     - Dependent artifacts updated
     - Next steps: "Run `/opsx:apply <name>` to re-sync implementation with updated artifacts" or "Continue modifying other artifacts"

**Output**

After completion, show:

```
## Modification Complete

**Change:** <name>
**Artifact:** <artifact-id>

### Changes Applied
- [Section]: [Action] - [Summary]

### Dependent Artifacts Updated
- [✓] <artifact-id>: [Summary]

### Next Steps
- Ready to implement: `/opsx:apply <name>`
- Continue modifying: [describe next artifact]
```

**Guardrails**
- Always read current artifact before modifying
- Check dependents before finalizing changes
- Use `rules` from instructions for validation (not CLI validate command)
- Use Edit for targeted changes, Write for complete rewrites
- Prefer reasonable decisions to keep momentum (0-1 dependents → auto-update)
- Pause and ask for clarification if unable to act autonomously
- Follow schema order for artifact selection
- IMPORTANT: `context` and `rules` are constraints for YOU, not content for the file
  - Do NOT copy `<context>`, `<rules>`, `<project_context>` blocks into the artifact
  - These guide what you write, but should never appear in the output
