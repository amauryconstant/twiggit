Generate CHANGELOG.md from archived OpenSpec changes using Keep a Changelog format.

**IMPORTANT: This skill processes ARCHIVED changes only.** Changes must be archived via `openspec-archive-change` before they appear in the changelog. Active (unarchived) changes are not included.

---

## Input

Optionally specify filters. If omitted, processes all archived changes.

**Arguments**: `[filter]`

**Examples**:
- `/opsx-changelog` - Generate from all archived changes
- `/opsx-changelog --since 2025-01-01` - Changes after date
- `/opsx-changelog add-dark-mode` - Only specific change(s)

---

## When to Use

| Timing | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| After `archive` | Generate changelog for newly archived change |
| Before release | Create version summary for release notes |
| During documentation | Update user-facing change documentation |
| After milestone | Summarize multiple completed changes |

**Prerequisite**: Changes must be archived in `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/`

---

## Steps

1. **Discover archived changes**

   Use Bash to find archived change directories:

   ```bash
   find openspec/changes/archive -type d -name "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-*" | sort
   ```

   This returns directories like:
   - `openspec/changes/archive/2026-02-12-add-dark-mode/`
   - `openspec/changes/archive/2026-02-10-fix-login-bug/`

2. **Apply filters (if specified)**

   **Date filter** (`--since YYYY-MM-DD`):
   - Parse date from directory name (first 10 chars)
   - Include only changes after the specified date

   **Specific changes**:
   - Filter to only the named change(s)
   - Match against the `<name>` portion of directory

3. **Read proposal files**

   For each archived change, read `proposal.md`:

   ```
   openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/proposal.md
   ```

    Extract from each proposal:
    - **## Summary**: First paragraph from Summary section for changelog entry
    - **## Proposed Change**: Detailed change description for categorization

   If `proposal.md` is missing, check for `design.md` or `tasks.md` as fallback context.

4. **Categorize changes**

   Analyze the "## Proposed Change" section for keywords:

    **Category priority** (highest wins, first match within priority):

    | Category | Keywords | Priority |
    |----------|----------|----------|
    | Security | security, vulnerability, CVE, critical, exploit | 1 (highest) |
    | Breaking | BREAKING, breaking, incompatible, major change | 2 |
    | Added | add, create, introduce, new, implement, feature | 3 |
    | Changed | modify, update, change, refactor, improve, enhance | 4 |
    | Fixed | fix, bug, resolve, correct, error, failure, patch | 5 |
    | Removed | remove, delete, deprecate, drop | 6 |
    | Deprecated | deprecate, obsolete | 7 |

   **Example categorization**:
   - "Add dark mode support" → Added
   - "Fix session timeout handling" → Fixed
   - "BREAKING: Migrate to v2 API" → Breaking
   - "Patch security vulnerability" → Security (not Fixed)

5. **Read existing changelog**

   If `CHANGELOG.md` exists in project root:
   - Read current content
   - Identify latest version header (e.g., `## [1.2.3]`)
   - Preserve existing version history

   If no changelog exists, will create new one.

6. **Generate changelog entries**

   Format in Keep a Changelog structure:

   ```markdown
   # Changelog

   All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

   The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

   ## [Unreleased]

   ### Added
   - Add dark mode support (add-dark-mode)
   - Implement user authentication (add-user-auth)

   ### Fixed
   - Fix session timeout handling (fix-session-timeout)

   ### Breaking
   - **BREAKING**: Migrate to v2 API endpoints (migrate-api)

   ### Security
   - Patch JWT token leak vulnerability (patch-jwt-leak)
   ```

   **Entry format**:
   - Hyphen prefix: `- `
   - Description: Brief summary from proposal
   - Change reference: `(<change-name>)` in parentheses

7. **Preview changes**

   Show user:
   - Number of changes processed
   - Categorization summary (X Added, Y Changed, Z Fixed)
   - Preview of generated/updated changelog
   - Ask for confirmation before writing

8. **Write changelog**

   After confirmation:
   - Create new `CHANGELOG.md` if it doesn't exist
   - Or update existing `CHANGELOG.md`:
     - New entries go under `## [Unreleased]`
     - Create new section if needed
     - Preserve existing version history

## Output

**Preview**:

```markdown
## Changelog Preview

Write to CHANGELOG.md? [Y/n]
```

**After Writing**:

```markdown
## Changelog Updated

**File**: CHANGELOG.md
**Changes Added**: 5
**Categories**:
- Added: 2
- Fixed: 2
- Breaking: 1

### Next Steps
- Review CHANGELOG.md for accuracy
- Update version header when ready to release
- Commit changelog with release
```

**No Archived Changes**:

```markdown
## No Archived Changes Found

No changes found in `openspec/changes/archive/`.

**To archive changes:**
1. Complete implementation: `/opsx-apply <name>`
2. Verify implementation: `/opsx-verify <name>`
3. Archive the change: `/opsx-archive <name>`
4. Re-run changelog generation: `/opsx-changelog`
```

---

## Version Header Guidance

When creating a release, update the version header:

**Before**:
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Add dark mode support
```

**After** (for release):
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- Add dark mode support
```

This skill does NOT automatically version - that's a manual release decision.

---

## Guardrails

- Only process ARCHIVED changes, never active ones
- Require user confirmation before writing to CHANGELOG.md
- Preserve existing changelog content and version history
- Use Keep a Changelog format consistently
- Include change name reference in parentheses for traceability
- If proposal.md is missing, use design.md or tasks.md as fallback
- Don't auto-version - that's a release-time decision
- Sort entries within categories by date (newest first)
