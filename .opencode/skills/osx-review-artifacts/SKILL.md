# osx-review-artifacts

Read-only, schema-driven audit of the planning artifacts in a change. Emits a routing report — never edits artifacts. Reading is allowed on every concrete file listed in `artifactPaths.<id>.existingOutputPaths`.

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone OpenSpec repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `openspec store list --json` to discover registered store ids, then pass `--store <id>` on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, `context`, `schemas`, `view`). Once selected, treat `--store <id>` as sticky for the rest of the workflow. Without a store, commands act on the nearest local `openspec/` root. Full flag matrix in `references/store-selection.md`.

> **Schema-agnostic contract** — see `references/schema-agnostic-contract.md`.

Sits in the pre-implementation workflow between artifact creation (`/osc-continue-change`, `/osc-propose`, `/osc-ff-change`) and implementation (`/osc-apply-change`). Use it standalone via `/osx-review <change>` or as part of PHASE0.

**Input**: Optionally specify `[<change-name>]` as `$1` (e.g., `/osx-review add-auth`). PHASE0 dispatches the change name automatically. For ad-hoc invocations: if omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context; auto-select if only one active change exists; otherwise run `openspec list --json` and prompt via `AskUserQuestion`. Mark the most-recently modified active change as `(Recommended)`. When the change is store-backed, carry `--store <id>` on every `openspec …` command.

---

**Steps**

1. **Select the change** — If a name is provided (as `$1`), use it. Otherwise:
   - Infer from conversation context if the user mentioned a change
   - Auto-select if only one active change exists
   - If ambiguous, run `openspec list --json` to get available changes and ask the user to select one with `AskUserQuestion`. Mark the most-recently modified active change as `(Recommended)`.

   Always announce: "Using change: <change-name>" and how to override (e.g., `/osx-review <other>`).

2. **Load schema state**

   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" [--store "<id>"] --json
   ```

   Capture:

   - `schemaName` — the workflow schema id (e.g. `"spec-driven"`).
   - `planningHome`, `changeRoot` — path context (do not assume repo-local paths).
   - `artifactPaths.<id>.{outputPath, resolvedOutputPath, existingOutputPaths}`.
   - `artifacts[]` — array of `{id, status, missingDeps?, requires?}` with status in `{done, ready, blocked}`.
   - `isComplete`, `applyRequires`, `nextSteps`, `actionContext.allowedEditRoots`.

   > **v1.7.0 contract**: each entry in `artifacts[]` carries a `requires` array of the artifact ids it directly depends on. This is the preferred input for Step 4's dependency graph. Fall back to `instructions --json` `dependencies`/`unlocks` only when `requires` is absent.

   For each artifact with `status == "done"` and non-empty `existingOutputPaths`, queue it for the per-artifact audit (Step 3). Skip `ready` and `blocked` — those are frontier concerns, reported in Step 7.

   If `isComplete` is already `true`, the schema is satisfied; the cross-artifact audit (Step 4) is still worth running.

   a. **Build spec inventory (v1.13.0+, additive)**

   ```bash
   openspec list --specs [--store "<id>"] --json
   # for each spec id in the response:
   openspec show "<spec-id>" --type spec --json --no-scenarios [--store "<id>"]
   ```

   Capture:

   - The full spec inventory as `{spec_id -> {path, purpose, requirements_count}}`.
   - The filtered read for each spec keeps the bulk read small enough to enumerate on every capability (the `--no-scenarios` flag).

   > **v1.13.0 contract**: `openspec list --specs` is the first-class spec-inventory command (parallel to `openspec list` for changes). The filtered read `openspec show <id> --type spec --json --no-scenarios` is what generated guidance uses. PHASE0 spec-aware review builds the inventory here and consumes it in Step 4's "Capability-already-exists" check.

   If the inventory can't be built (older core, missing `--specs` flag, CLI failure), skip Step 2b and the new Step 4 check — backwards-compatible with v1.11.0 cores. Do not raise.

3. **Per-artifact compliance audit**

   For each queued artifact, run:

   ```bash
   openspec instructions "<artifact-id>" --change "<name>" [--store "<id>"] --json
   ```

   Read each concrete file in `existingOutputPaths`. Validate against:

   - **`template`** — structural conformance: required sections, header levels, required elements per the schema body.
   - **`instruction`** — schema-defined prose guidance. Sets expectations, not copy-source.
   - **`rules`** — project-supplied overrides from `openspec/config.yaml`. Surface as additional checks; never copy into artifact content.
   - **`context`** — also a constraint; never copy into artifact content.

   Report each violation with `file_path:line` (approximate line is fine) and a concrete fix suggestion. Categorize each finding as one of:

   - **Critical** — the artifact is invalid (missing required section, broken scenario format, content contradicts a hard rule).
   - **Warning** — the artifact has a fixable defect (wrong header level, missing optional-but-recommended element).
   - **Suggestion** — a stylistic or clarity improvement.

   Use the rule adopted from `openspec-verify-change`: **when uncertain, prefer `Suggestion` over `Warning`, `Warning` over `Critical`**. Implementation-readiness concerns (Step 5) are never `Critical`.

   If the in-tree `spec-driven` schema's `template` field does not encode a format rule we used to hardcode (H4 scenario headers, `#### Scenario:` shape, etc.), file an upstream issue against the upstream OpenSpec project rather than re-adding a local rubric.

4. **Cross-artifact consistency report**

   Build a graph from each artifact's `requires` array (v1.7.0+, captured in Step 2 from `openspec status --json`). When a `requires` value is missing, fall back to that artifact's `dependencies` + `unlocks` from `openspec instructions --json`. Skip edges whose source artifact has no `existingOutputPaths`.

   For each existing edge **A → B** (A depends on B, both with concrete files):

   - **Entity coherence** — entities introduced in B that A consumes must be present in A; constraints declared in B must be honored by A; no orphan references.
   - **Severity** — coherence-level findings follow the same calibration rule.

   Do **not** hardcode any proposal↔specs↔design↔tasks pairs. The `requires` (or `dependencies` / `unlocks`) graph is fully schema-derived.

   If an artifact in the edge target has no concrete files (status `ready` or `blocked`), it belongs to Step 7 routing, not here.

   a. **Capability-already-exists (v1.13.0+, additive)**

   For each delta `ADDED Requirements` capability path:

   ```bash
   # Walk the inventory built in Step 2b:
   for spec_id in spec_inventory.keys(): ...
   # If the ADDED capability path is already in the inventory, flag it.
   ```

   If the spec inventory (Step 2b) has an existing capability at the same path as the delta's `ADDED Requirements` block, emit a `Warning` finding naming the existing spec id and pointing to `/osc-update-change <name>` — the right way to MODIFY/extend an existing capability is `update`, not a fresh `ADDED Requirements` block in a new change. The `Suggestion` ↔ `Warning` ↔ `Critical` calibration rule applies (prefer `Suggestion`).

   Skip Step 4b when the spec inventory is unavailable (older core, CLI failure) — backwards-compatible with v1.11.0 cores. Do not raise.

5. **Implementation-readiness** — Stay under `Suggestion` severity. Implementation readiness is human judgment: feasibility, scope, dependency availability, ambiguous requirements. Never `Critical`.

6. **Classify findings** — Apply the verify calibration rule once more across the whole report. Severity buckets produce distinct routing paths:
   - `Critical` / `Warning` → blocked; routing required before apply.
   - `Suggestion` → optional; user may proceed.

7. **Smart routing recommendation** — Produce one routing line per finding category. Pick the single best editor for the aggregate finding set. The route shape depends on whether the audit was dispatched by the orchestrator (`OSX_AUTONOMOUS=1` — the engine handles `/osc-update-change` itself and re-enters PHASE0 to verify) or invoked ad-hoc by a user (`OSX_AUTONOMOUS` unset — the user must run the slash command themselves):

   | Finding pattern | In-orchestration route | Ad-hoc route |
   |---|---|---|
   | Findings on existing artifacts (single- or multi-artifact) | `auto-fix:osc-update-change` (engine handles) | `/osc-update-change <name>` (user runs) |
   | Missing artifact (referenced but not created) | `/osc-continue-change <name>` (halt + surface) | `/osc-continue-change <name>` |
   | All clean, pre-impl (PHASE0) | `advance-to PHASE1` (no slash needed) | `/osc-apply-change <name>` |
   | Intent-level change detected | `/osc-new-change <name>` (halt + surface) | `/osc-new-change <name>` (per "Update vs. Start Fresh" heuristic) |
   | Ambiguous finding needing thinking time | `/osc-explore <name>` (halt + surface) | `/osc-explore <name>` |

   Exactly one routing line, matching this matrix.

   The review skill never invokes the routed command itself. It only emits the route so the engine (in `OSX_AUTONOMOUS=1` context) or the user (ad-hoc) can act.

**Output**

**Issues found**:

```
## Artifact Review: <change-name>

**Schema**: <schemaName>
**Artifacts audited**: <count>

### <Severity> findings
- **<artifact-id>:<file:line>**: <issue>
  - Fix: <concrete fix>
  - Route: <auto-fix:osc-update-change | /osc-update-change|/osc-continue-change|/osc-apply-change|/osc-new-change|/osc-explore> <name>

### Routing recommendation
<single sentence picking ONE of the routes from §Step 7; "auto-fix:..." prefix marks in-orchestration routes the engine handles itself>

### Next steps
- In `OSX_AUTONOMOUS=1` (PHASE0 dispatched): the engine clears routes_pending, invokes the routed slash command, then re-enters PHASE0. No user action.
- Otherwise (ad-hoc `/osx-review <change>`): address findings via the routed command above, then re-run `/osx-review <name>`.
```

**All checks passed**:

```
## Artifact Review: <change-name>

### All checks passed

**Schema compliance**: All artifacts conform to their templates and rules.
**Cross-artifact consistency**: No drift detected across the dependency graph.
**Implementation readiness**: <brief judgment>

### Next steps
- In `OSX_AUTONOMOUS=1` (PHASE0 dispatched): engine advances to PHASE1.
- Otherwise (ad-hoc `/osx-review <change>`): start (or resume) implementation with `/osc-apply-change <name>`.
```

---

**Guardrails**

- **Read-only.** Emits findings; never edits artifacts.
- **No code edits.** Surface issues, route the user to `/osc-apply-change`.
- **No new artifacts.** Missing artifacts are reported; their creation is `/osc-continue-change`'s job.
- **No hardcoded artifact names.** Schema is the source of truth.
- **Mode detection via `OSX_AUTONOMOUS` env var.** When set (orchestrator-dispatched PHASE0), the routing table's "in-orchestration" column applies — `auto-fix:osc-update-change` is emitted and the engine reconciles. When unset (ad-hoc `/osx-review <change>`), the "ad-hoc" column applies — slash-command forms are emitted for the user.

---

## Failure modes

- **`openspec status` returns no change** — confirm the change name (and `--store` if applicable); offer `openspec list --json` to help the user.
- **`openspec instructions` errors mid-audit** — report which artifact failed and stop; do not invent instructions from the schema body.
- **`isComplete` is false and no `ready` artifact exists** — unusual state; surface as `Suggestion` and ask the user whether they want to archive or start a new change.
