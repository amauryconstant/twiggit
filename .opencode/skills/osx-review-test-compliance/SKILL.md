# osx-review-test-compliance

Surface spec-to-test alignment to identify gaps for OpenSpec changes.

> **IMPORTANT**: This is a semantic analysis skill, not a CLI tool. Read spec files, discover test files, analyse coverage by comparing scenarios to test implementations.

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone OpenSpec repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `openspec store list --json` to discover registered store ids, then pass `--store <id>` on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, `context`, `schemas`, `view`). Once selected, treat `--store <id>` as sticky for the rest of the workflow. Without a store, commands act on the nearest local `openspec/` root.

**Input**: Optionally specify `[<change-name>]` as `$1` (e.g., `/osx-verify-tests add-auth`). PHASE1 end-of-iteration dispatches the change name automatically. For ad-hoc invocations: if omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context; auto-select if only one active change exists; otherwise run `openspec list --json` and prompt via `AskUserQuestion`. When the change is store-backed, carry `--store <id>` on every `openspec …` command.

When to use: after implementation, between `/osc-apply-change` and `/osc-archive-change`.

**Steps**

1. **Select the change** — If a name is provided (as `$1`), use it. Otherwise:
   - Infer from conversation context
   - Auto-select if only one active change exists
   - If ambiguous, run `openspec list --json` to get available changes and ask the user to select one with `AskUserQuestion`

   Always announce: "Analysing test compliance for: <change-name>" and how to override (e.g., `/osx-verify-tests <other>`).

2. **Check change status**

   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```

   Parse the JSON to identify the change directory path.

3. **Read spec files**

   Read all spec files from `openspec/changes/<name>/specs/`:

   ```bash
   openspec/changes/<name>/specs/**/*.md
   ```

   For each spec file, extract:
   - **Requirement names**: Lines matching `### Requirement: <name>`
   - **Scenario names**: Lines matching `#### Scenario: <name>`
   - **Scenario content**: GIVEN/WHEN/THEN/AND clauses following each scenario

4. **Discover test files**

   Use Glob to find test files. Start with common patterns:

   | Language | Pattern |
   |----------|---------|
   | Go | `**/*_test.go` |
   | Python | `**/test_*.py`, `**/*_test.py` |
   | JavaScript/TypeScript | `**/*.test.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}`, `**/*.spec.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}` |
   | Java | `**/*Test.java` |
   | Ruby | `**/*_spec.rb` |

   If `openspec/config.yaml` exists, check the `context` field for project-specific test patterns.

5. **Extract test behaviours**

   For each test file, read its contents and extract:
   - **Test function names**: e.g., `TestLoginFlow`, `test_user_authentication`
   - **Assertion patterns**: Look for `assert`, `expect`, `should`, `t.Error`
   - **Test descriptions**: Describe blocks, docstrings, comments

   Identify what behaviour each test validates based on its name and assertions.

6. **Match scenarios to tests**

   For each spec scenario, find matching tests by comparing:

   **Semantic similarity factors**:
   - **Action alignment** — does the test name/description contain verbs from the scenario? (e.g., "submits", "validates", "returns")
   - **Entity overlap** — do both reference the same domain objects? (e.g., "token", "credentials", "user")
   - **Outcome correspondence** — does the test verify the expected outcome?

   **Confidence scoring** — see `references/scoring-rubric.md` for tier definitions and worked examples.

7. **Generate gap analysis**

   Compile findings into two sections: **Coverage by requirement** (each scenario's match status and confidence, with notes for missing or partial coverage) and **Orphaned tests** (tests that don't match any scenario — may indicate missing specs or utility tests).

8. **Output compliance report**

   Present the analysis with actionable recommendations.

**Output**

**Full Compliance Report**:

```markdown
## Test Compliance Report: <change-name>

### Summary
- Total requirements: 5
- Total scenarios: 12
- Scenarios with tests: 9
- Scenarios without tests: 3
- Orphaned tests: 2

### Coverage by Requirement

#### Requirement: User Authentication
| Scenario | Coverage | Matching Tests | Notes |
|----------|----------|----------------|-------|
| Valid credentials | High (85%) | `TestLoginFlow` | Happy path covered |
| Invalid credentials | None | — | Missing: add negative test |
| Token expiry | Partial (60%) | `TestTokenRefresh` | Missing: expired token handling |

#### Requirement: Session Management
| Scenario | Coverage | Matching Tests | Notes |
|----------|----------|----------------|-------|
| Session timeout | None | — | No test for timeout |
| Concurrent sessions | High (90%) | `TestConcurrentLogin` | Covered |

### Gaps Analysis

| Gap Type | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Untested scenarios | 3 | "Invalid credentials", "Token expiry", "Session timeout" |
| Partially covered | 2 | Token refresh missing expired token case |
| Orphaned tests | 2 | `TestHelperFunction`, `TestLoadFixture` |

### Recommendations
1. Add test `TestInvalidCredentials()` to cover negative auth case
2. Add test `TestExpiredToken()` to cover token expiry scenario
3. Add test `TestSessionTimeout()` to cover session timeout scenario
4. Document orphaned tests `TestHelperFunction` as utility functions

### Next Steps
- Address gaps: Add recommended tests
- Re-run compliance: `/osx-verify-tests <name>`
- Verify implementation: `/osc-verify-change <name>`
```

**Quick Summary** (for clean changes):

```markdown
## Test Compliance: <change-name>

✅ **All scenarios covered**

- 5 requirements, 12 scenarios
- All scenarios have corresponding tests
- 0 coverage gaps

Ready to verify: `/osc-verify-change <name>`
```

**Guardrails**

- Read actual test files — don't assume coverage from names alone.
- Report gaps, not just percentages — focus on what's missing.
- Acknowledge utility tests that don't map to scenarios (orphaned tests).
- Don't require 100% coverage — focus on critical path scenarios.
- Confidence scores are subjective — explain reasoning per the scoring rubric.
- If no tests exist, report that clearly rather than failing.

---

## Tips

- Run on a single change at a time — multi-change compliance analysis bloats the report and dilutes per-change findings.
- For languages not in the table (Rust, Kotlin, Swift), check `openspec/config.yaml`'s `context` field for project-specific test patterns before scanning.
- Use `references/scoring-rubric.md` to keep tier assignments (`High` / `Partial` / `None`) consistent across runs.
- Re-run after fixes to confirm previously-missing scenarios now have tests; the report does not store incremental state.
